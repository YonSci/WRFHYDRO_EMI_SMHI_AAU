# WRFHYDRO EMI SMHI AAU

WRF-Hydro Operationalization Task Team is a collaborative initiative between the Ethiopian Meteorological Institution (EMI), Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI), and Addis Ababa University (AAU). The team's primary objective is to successfully implement and operationalize the Weather Research and Forecasting Hydro (WRF-Hydro) model within the EMI.

WRF-Hydro is a state-of-the-art hydrological modeling system that integrates atmospheric and land surface processes. Its application in Ethiopia will significantly enhance the country's capabilities in:

  - Hydrological forecasting: Improving predictions of river flows, floods, and droughts.
  
  - Water resource management: Supporting sustainable water allocation and conservation.
  
  - Climate change adaptation: Assessing the impacts of climate change on water resources and developing adaptation strategies.

By leveraging the expertise and resources of EMI, SMHI, and AAU, the task team aims to establish a robust and reliable WRF-Hydro operational system that benefits Ethiopia's society and environment.
